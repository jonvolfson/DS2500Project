# DS2500Project

To get started:

-   Download git for your OS (windows, mac, linux)
-   clone the repo using the url https://github.com/jonvolfson/DS2500Project.git
    -   On windows I would navigate using the command line to the folder where I want to download the repo to (navigate by using 'cd &lt;folder name&gt;' repeatedly until I find the folder I want
    -   Once in the desired folder in windows, I would type 'git clone https://github.com/jonvolfson/DS2500Project.git' to install the repo in the current folder
    -   Open the folder within your coding environment and run starter.py

If you would like to make changes, I made branches for each person in the group (mine is jon). The main branch serves as the 'production' branch where all of the changes each of us makes is merged into. So whenever you are doing new work, always make sure it is in your branch. You can check which branch you are on by typing 'git branch' into the command line. You can change your branch by typing 'git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;'. In my case I would type 'git checkout jon'.
